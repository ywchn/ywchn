Hey there! my name is Yu-Wen Chen, sometime people just call me Chen as a nickname. I graduated as a master's student at [Oregon State University](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) majoring in Computer Science in June 2021. I'm currently working as a Computer Vision and Deep Learning Engineer at [Aerotract LLC](https://www.aerotractone.com//). My technology stack involves Pytorch, Tensorflow, Detectron2, SpaCy, MySQL, Scikit-Learn. I also love doing breakdance when I have time.
